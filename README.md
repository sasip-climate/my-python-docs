# py-code-docs
This repo contains an example and a tutorial how to build a documentation on-line on readthedocs.org for a python code internally documented with NumPy docstrings. You'll notice that it  is itself built using Readthedocs. 

**Access the tutorial** on readthedocs: [https://py-code-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://py-code-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

If you don't wish to share your code nor its internal docstrings, and you just wish to publish an "external" documentation about it, you can switch to the [simpler tuto](https://github.com/sasip-climate/my-docs-online) corresponding better to your case here.
